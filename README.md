# Wireless-NoticeBoard
🛠️ Project Overview
This Arduino project demonstrates communication using the HC-05 Bluetooth module, allowing wireless data transmission between an Arduino board and a Bluetooth-enabled device. It is ideal for beginners exploring serial communication and IoT applications.

🔧 Hardware Used
Arduino UNO (or compatible)

HC-05 Bluetooth module

Jumper wires

(Optional) Sensors or actuators depending on your implementation

📂 File Details
vinay_ksit_hc_05.ino – Main Arduino sketch containing the logic to initialize Bluetooth communication and process incoming data.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Circuit Setup
Connect the HC-05 to the Arduino:

VCC → 5V

GND → GND

TX → Arduino RX (Pin 0)

RX → Arduino TX (Pin 1) (use a voltage divider to avoid damage)

2. Uploading Code
Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board and port.

Upload the code while HC-05 is disconnected, then reconnect it after uploading.

3. Testing
Pair HC-05 with your mobile device or PC.

Use a serial monitor app (e.g., Serial Bluetooth Terminal) to send/receive data.

✅ Features
Initializes serial communication with HC-05

Receives and processes Bluetooth data

Modular and easily customizable for various applications
